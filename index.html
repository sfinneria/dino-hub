        <h2>dinosaurs definition:</h2>
        <h3>
          Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade
          Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between
          243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and
          timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research.
          They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
          Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance
          continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil
          record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from
          earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only
          dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene
          extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be
          divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian
          dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

        <h2>why dinosaurs died?</h2>
        <h3>
          The exact nature of this catastrophic event is still open to
          scientific debate. Evidence suggests an asteroid impact was the main
          culprit. Volcanic eruptions that caused large-scale climate change may
          also have been involved, together with more gradual changes to Earth's
          climate that happened over millions of years.
